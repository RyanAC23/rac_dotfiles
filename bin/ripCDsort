"""Take CD rips in subdirectories of the current directory and sort them by filetype.
   This saves me a lot of time I otherwise spend searching for filetypes and manually
   cutting/pasting them.

   main() can almost definitely be simplified, and it currently does 3 full passes of the
   album folders to ensure everything is moved. Since these folders are small (limited to
   the size of a typical 16bit audio CD I find at the thriftstore), this slowdown is not
   noticeable.

    Create a subdirectory within the current directory with the specified name.
